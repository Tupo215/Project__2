gRPC-server

The gRPC has one message defined which is the LocationMESSAGE. This has four componets 
defined which are id(integer), person_id(integer), creation_time(string), and coordinate(string).
It has one service which takes LocationMESSAGE and returns LocationMESSAGE. 
The gRPC has been set up in a way that you use the create.py file to make a new entry to the database
the location service will take information sent by the create.py and process to make sure the message
is within stated guide lines, when successful it will pass the message to be commited as a new entry to 
the database.
