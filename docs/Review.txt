Hello review

On the last review i was asked to change the way the locations-post calls the grpc which
I have done but please note that I have changed it to call it in the services instead of
directly in the api as this was causing an error which the only solution i could find was
to use the service to first put the data into a format the grpc can take in then pass it to
the grpc so for the implentation of calling the grpc-server plaese check the locations api 
service.
Another part I was asked to change was to make sure there is only one locations api. This 
I am failing to do as I am very much confused as to how i can reroute the fronted to use the
new locations-api. The only way I can do that is if I set as monilith which is not the aim
of the project as it is supposed to be a microservice. But I have not given up to try figure
it out but am also aware that time is running out and I have only completed one project so
if you would be kind enough to overlook this allow me to move on to the next project and
finish the course and in my spare time I come back to this change it reroute to the new 
locations api.
