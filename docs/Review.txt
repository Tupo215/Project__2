Hello review

On the last review i was asked to change the way the locations-post calls the grpc which
I have done but please note that I have changed it to call it in the services instead of
directly in the api as this was causing an error which the only solution i could find was
to use the service to first put the data into a format the grpc can take in then pass it to
the grpc so for the implentation of calling the grpc-server plaese check the locations api 
service.
